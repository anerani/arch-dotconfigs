# Arch Linux dotfile configs

A backup dump of my Arch Linux devices' dotfile configurations.

* ```.zshrc```: oh-my-zsh + personal customizations
* ```.Xresources```: Includes solarized theme and urxvt configurations.
* ```i3/*```: i3 configs.
* ```.xbindkeysrc```: Keybinds for ```fn``` and media keys that did not work on laptop out of the box.
